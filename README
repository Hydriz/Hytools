== Hytools 2 ==
This is the phase 2 rewrite of the Hytools software, aimed to completely
redesign the interface of the Hytools software and reduce the dependency
of the original HTML code from Wikipedia.

Please note that this is still very much in beta and we expect to be able
to officially release this version in late 2011/early 2012. Please conti-
nue to follow the changes in the trunk folder for the latest code changes.
