== Hytools 2.3 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET.

While many attempts have been made to make this version be able to work on as
many machines as possible, we are unable to guarantee that this version of
Hytools is able to provide a stable interface for users using this software as
a commercial purpose.

=== New features in 2.3 ===
* A new link is provided at the version number found at the bottom of every page
to link users to the Git repository of Hytools.
* Hytools now provides a new service of listing the Wikimedia database downloads
in the new "dumps" directory (previously found in the "private" directory).
