== Hytools 2.3 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET.

While many attempts have been made to make this version be able to work on as
many machines as possible, we are unable to guarantee that this version of
Hytools is able to provide a stable interface for users using this software as
a commercial purpose.

=== New features in 2.3 ===
* A new link is provided at the version number found at the bottom of every page
to link users to the Git repository of Hytools.
* Pages now use the $hyVersion variable instead of being hardcoded as the version
number, which may actually go out of date.
* Links to Wikimedia websites now point to the HTTPS version due to the requirement
on our part about using HTTPS, and thus to maintain a consistent protocol while
navigating across domains.
