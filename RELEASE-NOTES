== Hytools 2.2 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET.

While many attempts have been made to make this version be able to work on as
many machines as possible, we are unable to guarantee that this version of
Hytools is able to provide a stable interface for users using this software as
a commercial purpose.

=== New features in 2.2 ===
* HTML has now changed to PHP, but usage of PHP only appears in some parts of
the site. This is part of the transition to the phase 3 software of Hytools.
* Site notices can now be enabled using the $hySiteNotice configuration in
LocalSettings.php. Message will appear throughout the site itself, above the
first heading.
* When a visitor visits the site, they would be redirected to the SSL-enabled
site located in the ssl directory.
* Bots page has been removed following the CVT project becoming defunct.
* Links that point to the hosting repository of the software is now changed to
the new GitHub repository
